## Overview

The different message types in `cucumber-messages` have references to each other
using `id` fields. It's a bit similar to rows in a relational database, with
primary and foreign keys.

Consumers of these messages may want to *query* the messages for certain information.
For example, [@cucumber/react-components](https://github.com/cucumber/react-components) needs to know the status of
a [Step](https://github.com/cucumber/messages/blob/main/messages.md#step) as it
is rendering the [GherkinDocument](https://github.com/cucumber/messages/blob/main/messages.md#gherkindocument)

The Query library makes this easy by providing a function to look up the
status of a step, a scenario or an entire file.
